I created my website as a parallax website becuase it is pretty unique. I chose a white background so that the parallax would create a larger effect. I also used images that made the website look like smoke. I also used grey throughout the website to add on to the smoke. I was not able to finish the content of my website becuase I had a lot of problems with keeping my website saved in the beginning, but I worked as hard as I could.
